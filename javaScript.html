		Write an algorithm to create a guessing game. 
		Let the user know if the guess is too high or too low.
		If they guess the number, alert this fact and tell them how many guesses it took them.
		
		1. Create a Guessing game that creates a random number 1-10
		2. make sure it has a prompt that the player can type their guess into. 
		3. Create a loop that keeps going until the player guesses correctly
		4. create a code that counts how many guesses it takes before the player gets it correct.
		5. Use an alert and show them the number and how they did by creating a code that sees if the number is higher or lower than the players guess.
		6. include a code that says something like "You Win!!!" if they get it correct. Display the number of guesses it took.
		7. Loop back the start, but keep the number the same so that the higher or lower stays correct.
		8. Create a true false thing that asks the player/user if they would like to play again once they win. 
		9. if they say yes then restart the game. :D
